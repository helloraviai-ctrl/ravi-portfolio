      <p>
        AI isn’t just a buzzword — it’s a <strong>general-purpose technology</strong> that can raise
        productivity, expand access, and solve problems at scale. For India, that means better
        healthcare triage, personalized learning, efficient agriculture, transparent governance,
        and faster digital services.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this real, we must <strong>prioritize Indian languages</strong>, local datasets, and
        affordability. AI should be <strong>inclusive by design</strong>, with privacy and safety built-in.
        With the right skilling and entrepreneurship, India can not only adopt AI but <strong>lead</strong> in
        building for the next billion users.
